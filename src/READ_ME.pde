//IDEA IS BASEDX
//My idea is based on the BladeRunner 2049 movie and by teh Inception Movie.
//I was particularly struck by a couple of scenes in the BladeRunner 2049 which I tried to replicate in my Program which you can see when you run it.
//The Idea of the Inception movie is when the R-Button is pressed the rain stops and as you release it, the rain changes 
//speed direction therefore giving the spectator a sense that the rain's gravity is repelling in slow-motion.

//The things I found difficult was implementing the gravity but I looked up on processing.org website to understand the functions such as the mapping features so
//I could find a way implementing it in my Program, but I really enjoyed making this Project and I think it was worth it.
